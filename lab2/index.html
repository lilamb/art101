			<h1>Lab 2 - HTML & CSS Starter</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>We must make a webpage with HTML that has a heading called "Hello World" and a pharagraph about us and our partner. 
						Then we go to CSS and make our webpage pretty. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>One of our problems is that me and my partner do not know how to do CSS. 
						So we are waiting till Modes teaches us the basics of CSS so we can finish out lab. Now that we learned css one of out probmels 
						was that I had a hard time connecting my heading and body to be edited separately. With looking back at Modes lecture slided I found 
						my problem and fixed it.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>we put lots of energy into this assignment. It went smoother than expected. 
						I understood most if not all of the code that needed to be done. 
						I also helped my lab partner understand the code as well. I liked that we called on discord to finish the lab
						and figure out how to work css. 
						 </p>
