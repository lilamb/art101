			<h1>Lab 12 -  Conditionals</h1>
			<div class="minor-section-one">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p> Our challenge was to use function that depents on Conditionals in order to have the user be sorted into a Hogwarts House.
						 </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section-two">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>One of my problmes is that I have a hard time using jQuery. It took me some time to convert it. I had to do it in Pure JS 
                        first then chance that into comments. After that I fiddled with Jquery. 
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section-three">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> Although this was hard I liked this lab and I now understand how to do this. Jquery is easier however I am still haveing a
                        hard time understanding. 
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section-four">
					<h2>Results</h2>
                        <p>As you can see we can have the user be sorted into a house.</p>
			</div>
                <div class="input-output">
                    <h2>Welcome to Hogwarts!</h2>
                    <p>Please be prepared to be sorted into your House.
                        Now enter your FUll name so you can be sorted.
