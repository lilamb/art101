			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Our challenge is to connect our files to a HTML homepage. Then from there we needed to
						add a picture of our reflection to lab 3 img. Once that is done we needed to take a screen shot
						of our reflections web page and add that picture to the Lab 3 img. Once that was done we finish
						our Homepage and make it all pretty using css.   
					</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>One of the problems that I was having was linking the files to the correct folder. After talking to 
						a freind he helped me realize that I all I needed was to add the two (..) to be able to connect 
						the file to folder. </p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This assignment was much harder than I expected probably becasue I am sick and my head can not think right. 
						Overall I think this assignment has been a easy challenge for me nothing that I could not overcome with a little
						bit of thinking and a few help from friends and partners.
