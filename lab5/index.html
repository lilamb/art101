					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p> We needed to write javascript in our console. Talking about the make, model, year, color, and age 
						of our car that we chose. After that we transfered our code to javascript. 
						Then we needed to link javascript to index.html. After that all we needed to do is use 
						CSS to make things nice and pretty.

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Surprisingly we had no truble what so ever with this lab.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> In all honesty this was a easy lab. There where no trubles, it was a smooth ride. 
						We knew what we where doing.
