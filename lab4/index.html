			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocode and Problem Solvinga</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>We needed to Pseudocode a example of something that most people don't know how to do. 
						Along with Pseudocodeing a Rock, Paper, Sccissors game. 
						We then needed to add the code to index.html. 
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>No problems for us except I was having a hard time connecting my image to the CSS to
						make the picture smaller</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> We put in a good amount of work. We deccided to call on Monday as I had plans over the weekend. We got all our 
						work done and where pretty productive. 
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
